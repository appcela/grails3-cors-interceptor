# grails3-cors-interceptor
Add Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers for Grails 3 applications.

# Grails 3+ Only

This plugin will add a new Interceptor (see [Grails 3 Interceptor API](https://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/single.html#interceptors)) to your Grails app that adds CORS headers to all your controllers and actions.

# Grails 2.x

For Grails 2.x app, please use the execellent [CORS Plugin](https://github.com/davidtinker/grails-cors). In fact, this plugin is based on the Grails 3 servlet filter code provided in the README by that plugin author. The filter code is rewritten as interceptor for this plugin.
